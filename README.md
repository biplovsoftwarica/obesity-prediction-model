# Obesity Prediction Model

## Overview
This project involves building a machine learning model to predict the obesity category of a person based on various features such as age, height, weight, BMI, and gender. The model is trained using a dataset from Kaggle.


## Dataset
The dataset used for training the model is titled "Obesity Classification Dataset" and can be found on Kaggle: [Obesity Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sujithmandala/obesity-classification-dataset).

## Features
The model uses the following features to predict the obesity category:
- Age
- Height (cm)
- Weight (kg)
- BMI
- Gender (encoded as a binary variable)

## Model
The model is built using the Random Forest Classifier from the scikit-learn library. It has been evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## Model Developer
 This is the first model that i ([Biplov Gautam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/biplov-gautam-a994ba282/)) build.
